# mc-conscionable-changes
this datapack changes minecraft to be a more conscionable experience (1.19+/format 10)

## current features
### animal relationship changes:
- smelt rotten flesh to make leather - allows for a humane(ish) source of leather

## ideas down the road
- reward converting zombie villagers to start a village as opposed to stealing a villager from their home
- reward planting saplings with experience points

i may never implement the above because i do not know the limits of datapacks
